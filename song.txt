As a child, you would wait
And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'll be the one
That work while they all play
And you, you lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things you that would change
But it was just a dream

Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
Here we are, don't turn away now
We are the warriors that built this town
From dust
